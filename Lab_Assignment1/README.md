Summary:



A hands-on Lab Assignment 1 notebook where we set up GitHub with GoogleColab, practice core Python, and use pandas to clean and merge student grade data, then visualize it. We finish by fitting polynomials with least squares at degrees 2, 4, and 6, comparing weighted vs unweighted fits using the dataâ€™s variances, and tidying the repo with a README and certificate.
